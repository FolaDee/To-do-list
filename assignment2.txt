Implement a youtube like page/app, but with images, with a main selection and a recommendations list on a sidebar.
The object per item conforms to the following JSON structure:

{
    id: 'id',
    name: 'The name of the image',
    url: 'image url',
    user: 'The user account/owner of the image',
    description: 'description of the image',
    views: 'number of views'
}

The main selection should show the image, and below it, the name and views, and on a separate line the description

The sidebar recommendations should show other images (not selected) as a list with the name, user and views and highlight
them as the main selection when selected. After a sidebar item is selected, the item should not remain on the sidebar but
be highlighted on the main section

Sample object:
{
    id: 1
    name: 'Special Image',
    url: '',
    user: 'Tobby',
    description: 'This is a special image',
    views: 1299924
}
